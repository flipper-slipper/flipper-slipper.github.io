							<h2>About</h2>
							<p> 
								I was hired as the 2nd technical employee at ReviMo, a resident startup at Mass Robotics in Boston developing a robotic mobility device for individuals with disabilities. As the 2nd technical employee, I held a lot of responsibilities and ownership over my tasks, which included testing our device, researching and sourcing new equipment, manufacturing the 4th gen prototype, and optimizing parts for manufacturing efficiency.
							</p>
							<p>
								I also presented our product to numerous groups including contract manufacturers and government officials at the MA State House. Overall, it was a great experience working in a fast-paced startup environment where my tasks covered a wide range of skills and I was responsible for taking ownership.
							</p>

							<h2>Testing Setup</h2>
							<div class="section-content">
								<div>
									<p>I designed and built an automated testing setup to validate the device's performance and reliability. The system was based on a wireless ESP32 that controlled actuators to toggle our device motors.</p>
									<p>I completed everything from researching different ways to simulate a human using our device and performing fatigue testing on mechanical componentsâ€”which ended with me breaking a fundamental piece!</p>

							<h2>Machining</h2>
							<div class="section-content">
								<div>
									<p>I machined numerous components on a CNC mill. This included creating CAM programs in Fusion 360, editing part designs to reduce the number of setups and tools required. This was one of my favorite parts of the summer as I got hands-on experience with design for manufacturing and machining, even taking advice from contract manufacturers to create parts that were easy to make.</p>
									<p>Some of my favorite parts included round steel parts and the part shown in the video to the right. I also powder coated parts for aesthetics which you can see in the gallery below.</p>

							<h2>Demo</h2>
